[Acme](http://research.swtch.com/acme) is an interesting visual editor. I say "interesting" because I feel it's cool as well as confusing. Frankly, I don't quite catch its design goal and how it can improve user's productivity. I just feel it's cool.

It successfully integrate command and edit in one editor. In the [tour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1xVpMPn8M), Russ Cox calls acme as an Integrating Development Environment rather than editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Acme brings system tools closer together. Each selected text can be considered as system wide command.

Above all, the main point of this post is to introduce how to use acme on Mac, especially with trackpad.

Acme heavily uses mouse input. Left and right button are well defined on trackpad. But where is the middle button? After a few searches, I finally find that use Option + Left Button can simulate middle button in acme without any 3rd party software. Therefore, I can start to use acme now.

P.S. acme pronounces as `['Ã¦kmi]`.
