I was using Evernote to write my random technical notes. That's very convinient for me in most cases, except when I want to write code in a note.

Evernote is a good tool to create post with text and image, but not code. There is no way to format code. And there is no quick way for me to mark a selected text as monospaced. Finally, I decide to find an alternative tool.

Github pages is a good choice for me. I planned to use it about one year ago but gave up the plan for some reasons. Now, it's time to back.
