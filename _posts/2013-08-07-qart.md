[QArt](http://research.swtch.com/qart) is art in QR code. It looks amazing as this algorithm successfully mixes QR code information and a bitmap.

However, this algorithm has several limitations. The most significant one is that bitmap size and position is limited. I try to use it to create a QR code with my avatar but failed. A minor one is that there is lots of redundant information in generated QR code.

Maybe I can try to think of how to optimize it.
