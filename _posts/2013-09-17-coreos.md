[CoreOS](http://coreos.com/
) is a linux distribution for massive server deployment.

I feel CoreOS looks like "the sisters" system at first glance. CoreOS is, off course, more complex than "the sisters". It's an OS based on linux, while "the sisters" is designed as an user level software.

I should take a deeper look at CoreOS. It's interesting. And I also feel that "the sisters" is a system can be very useful in the near future. It's a trend to connect servers as a whole.

P.S. "the sisters" is a tool in planning phase. I'll start to work on it some day.
