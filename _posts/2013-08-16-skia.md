[Skia](https://sites.google.com/site/skiadocs/home) is a 2d graphic library supporting Android, Chrome, Firefox, etc. It's much more robust and powerful than cocos2d-x, which contains many terribly written code and wired design.

Skia is able to render image on OpenGL device as well as other devices like PDF or even a picture. It supports both GPU shader and CPU (soft) shader.

Skia is also a cross-platform project. It can run on all main stream platforms including iOS/Android/Windows Phone/Windows/Mac/etc.

Maybe I can consider to use Skia as backend in shana-ui in the future.
