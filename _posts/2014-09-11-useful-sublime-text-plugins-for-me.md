I may update this post when I install new plugins and feel its useful.

Here is a list of plugins I use now.

* Package Control

  This is a MUST-BE installed plugins. It's the best way to install other plugins.

* ConvertToUTF8 + Codecs33

  These two plugins can help me to detect and convert text files containing CJK characters. Many Windows text files are encoded with GBK if it comes from a Windows computer using Simplified Chinese locale. I've got a lot trouble to read them. These plugins can save my life.

* DashDoc

  Dash is a great tool to manage and read lots of development documents in one place. DashDoc is the official plugins to integrate Sublime Text with Dash. I can look up document by clicking keyword in Sublime Text with it.

* Git

  Git plugins can show file's git status and more. It helps me to understand source file status.
